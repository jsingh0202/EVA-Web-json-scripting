# EVA-Web-json-scripting

This script takes json data (recieved from Matt) of the current state of the EVA website. It then outputs a list of all the ids within the data.

## Running the Script

1. To create the venv, run `python -m venv env` in the project terminal. This may take some time.
2. Then run `env\Scripts\activate`.
3. Install all the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. If you add any new dependecies, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
5. Once you finish, run `deactivate` to deactivate the venv.

You may run step 2 once you have a venv set up for this project in the future.
